<h4>Your Right to use Content on the SWAYAM Site</h4>
Unless indicated as being in the public domain, the content on the SWAYAM
Site is protected by Indian and foreign copyright laws. Unless otherwise
expressly stated on the SWAYAM Site, the texts, exams, video, images, and
other instructional materials provided with the courses and programs
offered on the SWAYAM Site are for your personal use in connection with
those courses and programs only. Certain reference documents, digital

<h4>Use for Personalization and Pedagogical Improvements</h4>
Our goal is to provide current and future visitors to the SWAYAM Site with
the best possible educational experience. To further this goal, we
sometimes present different users with different versions of course materials
and software. We do this to personalize the experience to the individual
learner (to assess the learner’s level of ability and learning style, and
present materials best suited to the learner), to improve our understanding
of the learning process, and to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of
our course materials, payment models, platform features, and offerings.
We may publish or otherwise publicize results from this process, but, unless
otherwise permitted under the Privacy Policy, those publications or public
disclosures will not include your personal information.

use and distribute your User Postings in a manner consistent with the
licenses granted by you below, and (2) that neither your submission of
your User Postings nor the exercise of the licenses granted below will
