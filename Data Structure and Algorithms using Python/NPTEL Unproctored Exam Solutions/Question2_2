Question2
Here is a function stablesortbad that takes a list of pairs of integers as input and sorts them by the first coordinate in each pair. A stable sort preserves the order of pairs that have an equal first coordinate. This is not a stable sort. Provide an input for which stablesortbad produces an output that is not stably sorted. Your input should be a list of pairs of integers of the form [(i1,j1),(i2,j2),â€¦,(in,jn)].

def stablesortbad(l):
 for j in range(len(l)-1):
 for i in range(len(l)-1):
 if l[i][0] >= l[i+1][0]:
 (l[i],l[i+1]) = (l[i+1],l[i])
 return(l)

Solution:
[(2,3),(2,1),(1,5),(1,2)]
