Question 4:-

Recall that the positions in a list of length n are 0,1,â€¦,n-1. We want to write a function evenpositions(l) that returns the elements at the even positions in l. In other words, the function should return the list [l[0],l[2],...]

For instance evenpositions([]) == [], evenpositions([7]) == [7], evenpositions([8,11,8]) == [8,8] and evenpositions([19,3,44,44,3,19]) == [19,44,3]. A recursive definition of evenpositions is given below. You have to fill in the missing argument for the recursive call.

Solution: 

[l[0]] + evenpositions(l[2:])
