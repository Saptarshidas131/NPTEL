Question 2

Here is a function stablesortbad that takes a list of pairs of integers as input and sorts them by the second coordinate in each pair. A stable sort preserves the order of pairs that have an equal second coordinate. This is not a stable sort. Provide an input for which stablesortbad produces an output that is not stably sorted. Your input should be a list of pairs of integers of the form [(i1,j1),(i2,j2),...,(in,jn)].

def stablesortbad(l):
  for j in range(len(l)-1):
    for i in range(len(l)-1):
      if l[i][1] >= l[i+1][1]:
        (l[i],l[i+1]) =  (l[i+1],l[i])
  return(l)    
Open up the code submission box below and write your test case where you would normally paste your code. Your input should be a list of pairs of integers of the form [(i1,j1),(i2,j2),...,(in,jn)].
