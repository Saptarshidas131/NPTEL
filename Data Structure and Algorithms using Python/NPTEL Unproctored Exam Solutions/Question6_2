Question 6:

Write a Python function uncommon(l1,l2) that takes two lists sorted in ascending order as arguments and returns the list of all elements that appear in exactly one of the two lists. The list returned should be in ascending order. All such elements should be listed only once, even if they appear multiple times in l1 or l2.

Thus, uncommong([2,2,4],[1,3,3,4,5]) should return [1,2,3,5] while uncommon([1,2,3],[1,1,2,3,3]) should return [].

Solution :

def uncommon(l1, l2):
  l1 = list(set(l1))
  l2 = list(set(l2))
  l3=[]
  for i in l2:
    if i not in l1:
      l3.append(i)
  for i in l1:
    if i not in l2 and i not in l3:
      l3.append(i)
    
  l3.sort()
  return l3
